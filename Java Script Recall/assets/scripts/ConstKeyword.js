console.log("Const keyword")

//const is a keyword used to declare a variable that has a constant value, meaning its value cannot be reassigned or changed once it is assigned. It is short for "constant."
//When you declare a variable using const, you must assign it a value at the time of declaration.

// Attempting to reassign the value will result in an error
