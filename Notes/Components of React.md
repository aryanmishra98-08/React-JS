# Basics of React

## Components
Components play a central role in React, acting as reusable building blocks comprising HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They allow developers to focus on core business logic rather than getting caught up in implementation details. Components can be combined and composed to construct the final user interface, promoting code reusability and efficiency.

## Separation of Concerns
React promotes separation of concerns through components, enhancing code manageability and maintainability. By leveraging components, developers can organize their code and achieve modularity and reusability, similar to how functions work in general programming practices.

## HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Integration
React's emphasis is on components that integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While CSS is important, it holds a lesser emphasis in React development. React empowers developers to create reusable and reactive components, allowing for efficient and non-repetitive code.

## Declarative Approach
React follows a declarative approach, focusing on defining the desired end state rather than manual DOM manipulation. React determines which elements to add, remove, or update based on the defined states. This simplifies the developer's workflow, as React handles the complexities of DOM manipulation under the hood.

## Building Custom HTML Elements
With React, developers can build and combine custom HTML elements to construct user interfaces. This enables greater flexibility and scalability in creating unique and tailored UI components.
