# What is React 
It's a library for web and native user interfaces.

# Why to use React instead of Javascript
JavaScript is a front-end programming language that is mainly used to add interactive elements to web pagesâ€”the search bar at the top of this page is a good example.  
ReactJS, on the other hand, is a JavaScript library.  A library is a set of pre-written codes that makes programming quicker. ReactJS provides code for making powerful user interfaces (UIs).

### Benefits of plain JavaScript
- Lower learning curve
- High performance
- There are no complex libraries or settings to configure
- Can be used for front-end and back-end (additional resources are usually recommended for the latter)
- Seamlessly integrates with other programming languages

### Disadvantages of plain JavaScript
- Time-consuming, as developers have to write a lot of code
- Does not always work well for large applications with complex features
- Lack of debugging facilities

### Benefits of ReactJS
- Renders complex content quickly on web pages
- Able to build rich user interfaces
- Easy to maintain and update the components
- High performance
- Extensive debugging tools

### Disadvantages of ReactJS
- Steep learning curve
- Geared for front-end only
- Does not support older browsers

# Basics of React

## Components
Components play a central role in React, acting as reusable building blocks comprising HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They allow developers to focus on core business logic rather than getting caught up in implementation details. Components can be combined and composed to construct the final user interface, promoting code reusability and efficiency.

## Separation of Concerns
React promotes separation of concerns through components, enhancing code manageability and maintainability. By leveraging components, developers can organize their code and achieve modularity and reusability, similar to how functions work in general programming practices.

## HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Integration
React's emphasis is on components that integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While CSS is important, it holds a lesser emphasis in React development. React empowers developers to create reusable and reactive components, allowing for efficient and non-repetitive code.

## Declarative Approach
React follows a declarative approach, focusing on defining the desired end state rather than manual DOM manipulation. React determines which elements to add, remove, or update based on the defined states. This simplifies the developer's workflow, as React handles the complexities of DOM manipulation under the hood.

## Building Custom HTML Elements
With React, developers can build and combine custom HTML elements to construct user interfaces. This enables greater flexibility and scalability in creating unique and tailored UI components.
