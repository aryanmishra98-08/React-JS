It's a library for web and native user interfaces.

**Why to use React instead of Javascript**  
JavaScript is a front-end programming language that is mainly used to add interactive elements to web pages—the search bar at the top of this page is a good example.  
ReactJS, on the other hand, is a JavaScript library.  A library is a set of pre-written codes that makes programming quicker. ReactJS provides code for making powerful user interfaces (UIs).
